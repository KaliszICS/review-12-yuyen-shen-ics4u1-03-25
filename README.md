# Instructions  

  ## Questions

1. Write a method called isPalindrome(String word)</br>
It takes in a word and checks if it is a palindrome.</br>
A palindrome means that the characters are the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces.</br>


Examples of palindromes:</br>


- racecar</br>
- was it a car or a cat I saw</br>
- never odd or even</br>
- rats live on no evil star</br>


Your check should be case **insensitive** and should ignore spaces.  For example, "Bob" is a palindrome, despite the first B being capitalized.
Your method will return true if it's a palindrome false otherwise.

2. Create a function called _getAge()_, which takes in a String array (names), integer array (ages) and String (name) as parameters.
Names and ages are parallel arrays.  Return the age associated with the name.

3. Create a function called _countWords()_</br>
It takes in a String and a character as parameters.</br>
Return how many words in the string contain the letter.</br>
